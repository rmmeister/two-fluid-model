# two-fluid-model

The Two Fluid Model (TFM) is used to describe the flow behavior of a stratified two phase flow in a horizontal pipe with diameter of 0.032 m. The inlet T and P are 20ºC and 0.15 MPa respectively. The liquid flow rate is 80 Kg/m2s. Simulate the above stratified two phase flow for a steady state incompressible flow at various αgρg ranging from 10 to 50 m/s (10, 20, 30, 40, 50). Plot P, αg, αL, vL and vg versus αgρg 
μg= 1.78×10-5 μL= 9.98×10-4 kg/ms σL= 0.073 N/m ρg= 1.725kg/m3
ρL= 998 kg/m3
